Model Architecture: BLIP with CNN & LSTM Concepts
üß† Core Model: BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)
Model Type: Vision-Language Transformer
Base Model: Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base
Input: RGB Images (1024x1024 max)
Output: Natural Language Captions

üîç How CNN Concepts Are Incorporated
1. Visual Feature Extraction (CNN-like Processing)
python
# Behind the scenes in BLIP's image encoder:
img_patches = split_image_into_patches(image)  # Like CNN's receptive fields
patch_embeddings = linear_projection(img_patches) + position_embeddings

Patch Processing:

Divides image into 16x16 patches (similar to CNN's local receptive fields)

Linear projection of patches mimics CNN's convolutional filters

Hierarchical Features:

Multi-head self-attention layers build feature hierarchies

Lower layers detect edges/textures (like early CNN layers)

Higher layers detect objects/scenes (like deep CNN layers)

2. LSTM-like Text Generation

# Text decoder operates sequentially:
for token in output_sequence:
    next_token = transformer_decoder(
        current_tokens, 
        visual_features  # CNN-extracted features
    )
    current_tokens.append(next_token)

    Sequential Processing:

Generates tokens one-by-one (like LSTM)

Maintains hidden state through self-attention

Beam Search:
num_beams=5  # Explores multiple sequence possibilities

Keeps top N probable sequences (like LSTM's beam search)
